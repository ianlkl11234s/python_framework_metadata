## st.plotly_chart

Display an interactive Plotly chart.

Plotlyis a charting library for Python.
The arguments to this function closely follow the ones for Plotly'splot()function.

To show Plotly charts in Streamlit, callst.plotly_chartwherever
you would call Plotly'spy.plotorpy.iplot.

Important

You must installplotlyto use this command. Your app's
performance may be enhanced by installingorjsonas well.

st.plotly_chart(figure_or_data, use_container_width=True, *, theme="streamlit", key=None, on_select="ignore", selection_mode=('points', 'box', 'lasso'), **kwargs)

figure_or_data(plotly.graph_objs.Figure, plotly.graph_objs.Data,            or dict/list of plotly.graph_objs.Figure/Data)

The PlotlyFigureorDataobject to render. Seehttps://plot.ly/python/for examples of graph descriptions.

use_container_width(bool)

Whether to override the figure's native width with the width of
the parent container. Ifuse_container_widthisTrue(default),
Streamlit sets the width of the figure to match the width of the parent
container. Ifuse_container_widthisFalse, Streamlit sets the
width of the chart to fit its contents according to the plotting library,
up to the width of the parent container.

theme("streamlit" or None)

The theme of the chart. Ifthemeis"streamlit"(default),
Streamlit uses its own design default. IfthemeisNone,
Streamlit falls back to the default behavior of the library.

key(str)

An optional string to use for giving this element a stable
identity. IfkeyisNone(default), this element's identity
will be determined based on the values of the other parameters.

Additionally, if selections are activated andkeyis provided,
Streamlit will register the key in Session State to store the
selection state. The selection state is read-only.

on_select("ignore" or "rerun" or callable)

How the figure should respond to user selection events. This
controls whether or not the figure behaves like an input widget.on_selectcan be one of the following:

- "ignore"(default): Streamlit will not react to any selection
events in the chart. The figure will not behave like an input
widget.
- "rerun": Streamlit will rerun the app when the user selects
data in the chart. In this case,st.plotly_chartwill return
the selection data as a dictionary.
- Acallable: Streamlit will rerun the app and execute thecallableas a callback function before the rest of the app.
In this case,st.plotly_chartwill return the selection data
as a dictionary.
selection_mode("points", "box", "lasso" or an Iterable of these)

The selection mode of the chart. This can be one of the following:

- "points": The chart will allow selections based on individual
data points.
- "box": The chart will allow selections based on rectangular
areas.
- "lasso": The chart will allow selections based on freeform
areas.
- AnIterableof the above options: The chart will allow
selections based on the modes specified.
All selections modes are activated by default.

**kwargs(null)

Any argument accepted by Plotly'splot()function.

(element or dict)

Ifon_selectis"ignore"(default), this command returns an
internal placeholder for the chart element. Otherwise, this command
returns a dictionary-like object that supports both key and
attribute notation. The attributes are described by thePlotlyStatedictionary schema.

#### Example

The example below comes straight from the examples athttps://plot.ly/python. Note thatplotly.figure_factoryrequiresscipyto run.

```python

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import plotly.figure_factory as ff

# Add histogram data
x1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2
x2 = np.random.randn(200)
x3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2

# Group data together
hist_data = [x1, x2, x3]

group_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']

# Create distplot with custom bin_size
fig = ff.create_distplot(
        hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])

# Plot!
st.plotly_chart(fig)

```

## Chart selections

### PlotlyState

The schema for the Plotly chart event state.

The event state is stored in a dictionary-like object that supports both
key and attribute notation. Event states cannot be programmatically
changed or set through Session State.

Only selection events are supported at this time.

selection(dict)

The state of theon_selectevent. This attribute returns a
dictionary-like object that supports both key and attribute notation.
The attributes are described by thePlotlySelectionStatedictionary
schema.

#### Example

Try selecting points by any of the three available methods (direct click,
box, or lasso). The current selection state is available through Session
State or as the output of the chart function.

```python

import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px

df = px.data.iris()  # iris is a pandas DataFrame
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length")

event = st.plotly_chart(fig, key="iris", on_select="rerun")

event

```

### PlotlySelectionState

The schema for the Plotly chart selection state.

The selection state is stored in a dictionary-like object that supports both
key and attribute notation. Selection states cannot be programmatically
changed or set through Session State.

points(list[dict[str, Any]])

The selected data points in the chart, including the data points
selected by the box and lasso mode. The data includes the values
associated to each point and a point index used to populatepoint_indices. If additional information has been assigned to your
points, such as size or legend group, this is also included.

point_indices(list[int])

The numerical indices of all selected data points in the chart. The
details of each identified point are included inpoints.

box(list[dict[str, Any]])

The metadata related to the box selection. This includes the
coordinates of the selected area.

lasso(list[dict[str, Any]])

The metadata related to the lasso selection. This includes the
coordinates of the selected area.

#### Example

When working with more complicated graphs, thepointsattribute
displays additional information. Try selecting points in the following
example:

```python

import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px

df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(
    df,
    x="sepal_width",
    y="sepal_length",
    color="species",
    size="petal_length",
    hover_data=["petal_width"],
)

event = st.plotly_chart(fig, key="iris", on_select="rerun")

event.selection

```

This is an example of the selection state when selecting a single point:

```python

{
  "points": [
    {
      "curve_number": 2,
      "point_number": 9,
      "point_index": 9,
      "x": 3.6,
      "y": 7.2,
      "customdata": [
        2.5
      ],
      "marker_size": 6.1,
      "legendgroup": "virginica"
    }
  ],
  "point_indices": [
    9
  ],
  "box": [],
  "lasso": []
}

```

## Theming

Plotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.

The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through thetheme="streamlit"keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, usetheme=Noneinstead.

`theme="streamlit"`

`theme=None`

Let's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:

`import plotly.express as px
import streamlit as st

df = px.data.gapminder()

fig = px.scatter(
    df.query("year==2007"),
    x="gdpPercap",
    y="lifeExp",
    size="pop",
    color="continent",
    hover_name="country",
    log_x=True,
    size_max=60,
)

tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Streamlit theme (default)", "Plotly native theme"])
with tab1:
    # Use the Streamlit theme.
    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.
    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme="streamlit", use_container_width=True)
with tab2:
    # Use the native Plotly theme.
    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)`

Click the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.

If you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!

Here's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:

`import plotly.express as px
import streamlit as st

st.subheader("Define a custom colorscale")
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(
    df,
    x="sepal_width",
    y="sepal_length",
    color="sepal_length",
    color_continuous_scale="reds",
)

tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Streamlit theme (default)", "Plotly native theme"])
with tab1:
    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme="streamlit", use_container_width=True)
with tab2:
    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)`

Notice how the custom color scale is still reflected in the chart, even when the Streamlit theme is enabled ðŸ‘‡
